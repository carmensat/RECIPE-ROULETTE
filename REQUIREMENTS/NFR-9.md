### ID: NFR-9
 
### Type/Subtype: Design Objectives

### Version: v2.1
 
### Title: Performance Optimization
  
### Description: 
The app should be optimized for performance, including efficient database queries, optimized image loading, and minimized network requests. Caching mechanisms should be used where appropriate to enhance speed and reduce latency. This optimization ensures a fast and responsive user experience, even under heavy load conditions
