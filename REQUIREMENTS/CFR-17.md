### Description: 
The Content Administrator is responsible for reviewing and editing existing content within the app to ensure accuracy and quality. This involves identifying content that needs revision based on user feedback, audits, or guideline changes. Once identified, the administrator revises and updates the content to correct errors, update information, or improve clarity. It's important to maintain a record of these revisions for auditing purposes. Additionally, if the revisions have a significant impact on users, the administrator communicates the changes, providing reasons and additional information for transparency.
