### ID: UFR-5

### Version: v2.0
 
### Title: Search Recipes by Dish Name
  
### Description: 
Users search for recipes by entering the dish name. They then navigate results to find what they need.

### Relations:
[UFR-1](https://github.com/carmensat/RECIPE-ROULETTE/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS/UFR-1.md), 
[UFR-6](https://github.com/carmensat/RECIPE-ROULETTE/blob/main/REQUIREMENTS/UFR-6.md).

### Comments: 
Users should be able to filter the recipes according to dietary restrictions or preferences. Users should be able to save recipes or download them to be able to access them off-line.  As with recipes, results should be obtained based on different queries (different languages..) as well as take into account possible errors in the query.  If no results are given the app could propose different related dishes.
