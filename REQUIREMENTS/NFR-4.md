### Comments: 
Implement scalable architecture and optimize server resources to accommodate spikes in user traffic. Utilize load balancing techniques, caching mechanisms, and horizontal scaling to distribute the load evenly across multiple servers. Conduct stress testing and performance tuning to identify and address bottlenecks before they impact user experience.
