### Comments: 
 The point system should be transparent, allowing users to understand how they earn points and what they can be redeemed for. The app should have a mechanism to prevent abuse or fraudulent behavior, such as spammy uploads or excessive referrals. Points should be trackable within the user profile, and users should have access to their point balance at all times. Points may have an expiration period to encourage continued engagement, with a notification system to alert users about upcoming expirations.
