### Comments: 

If the person selects the role wrongly they can go back to select a different role. The password should follow the following requirements:
* 8 to 10 characters
* A combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

If the information is invalid the user will return to the registration page where they have to enter their personal information to correct any errors.
