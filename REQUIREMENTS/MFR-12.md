### Comments: 
The management of software should be proactive, focusing on preventing issues rather than just responding to them. The software management team should have clear roles and responsibilities, with processes in place for escalations and emergency response.
Documentation should be maintained for all maintenance activities, including software updates, bug fixes, and performance reports.
