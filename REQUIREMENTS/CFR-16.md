### Title: Delete recipe
  
### Description: 

The Content Administrator has the ability to delete recipes from the app, typically in response to violations of community guidelines, user requests, or inactivity. This function ensures the integrity and quality of content within the app. The process of deleting a recipe involves:

* **Identify the Recipe:** The Content Administrator identifies the recipe to be deleted, either from user reports, guideline violations, or system audits.
* **Review and Justify Deletion:** Before deleting, the Content Administrator must review the reason for deletion to ensure it is justified and consistent with the app's policies.
* **Delete the Recipe:** Once the justification is confirmed, the recipe is deleted from the database. This removal is typically irreversible.
* **Notify the User:** If the deletion is due to a guideline violation or user report, the Content Administrator sends a notification to the user explaining the reason for deletion.

The Content Administrator should maintain a record of deleted recipes for auditing and accountability purposes. User notifications regarding deletions should be clear and provide guidance on next steps or appeal processes.
