### Version: v1.0
 
### Title: Check Reward Status 
  
### Description: 

Users can check their current point balance and view available rewards. This feature allows users to track their progress toward redeeming points for rewards, such as discounts, special content, or other incentives. The system should provide a clear interface showing:

* **Point Balance:** The current number of points the user has accumulated.
* **Rewards Catalogue:** A list of available rewards and the point cost for each.
* **Redeem Points:** A method to redeem points for a chosen reward, with clear instructions on how to complete the process.
* **Point History:** A detailed history of point transactions, including points earned, redeemed, or expired.

### Comments:

* The user interface for checking reward status should be intuitive and easy to navigate.
* The system should have mechanisms to prevent errors or misuse, such as double redemption or incorrect point calculations.
* Point balances should be updated in real-time to ensure accuracy.
* Notifications may be used to alert users about new rewards or points about to expire.
* The rewards system should be scalable to accommodate a growing user base and new reward type
