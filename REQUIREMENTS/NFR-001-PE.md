### Title: Performance
  
### Description: 
Ensure the system performs efficiently under expected and peak load conditions.
Details:

* **Response time:** The app should respond to user requests (e.g., searching for recipes, uploading recipes) within 2 seconds.
* **Load times:** The app's main screens (e.g., recipe search, user profile) should load in under 5 seconds.
+ **Concurrent users:** The app should support a large number of users concurrently without significant performance degradation. Aim for at least 5,000 to 10,000 concurrent users.
* **Data processing:** The app should handle large datasets (e.g., thousands of recipes) efficiently and without performance issues
